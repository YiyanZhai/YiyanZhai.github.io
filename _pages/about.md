I recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University 🎓 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Machine Learning. I have been working with with Prof. Tianqi Chen on:

* [WebLLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm): enabling local LLM inference directly in the browser.
* [WebLLM Assistant](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm-assistant): integrating Overleaf and Google Workspace with in-browser agents, using WebLLM.
* [Web-Agent-Interface](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-agent-interface): a generic bridge between LLM agents and their web environments.

I am also fortunate to collaborate with Prof. [Juncheng Yang](https://jasony.me/) on **distributed tracing systems** and **cache eviction algorithms**, with a focus on storage performance and data systems.
